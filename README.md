Matthew Rothman – Data Science & Analytics Projects

Hi! I'm Matthew Rothman, a data scientist and analyst with experience in predictive analytics, data visualization, and building data-driven tools. I enjoy analyzing complex datasets, uncovering insights, and creating solutions that support informed decision-making.

Projects
1. Heart Disease & Diabetes Predictive Analytics (DIMACS @ Rutgers University)

Predictive analytics project aimed at identifying key risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.

Uses patient data to explore relationships between lifestyle, demographics, and health outcomes.

Builds interpretable machine learning models to support healthcare insights.

Compares novel ML approaches with traditional statistical methods to find the most effective predictors.

2. Sports Betting ROI Optimization (Rutgers University)

Forecasting project focused on predicting division winners in sports leagues.

Analyzes historical sports data to identify patterns and trends.

Evaluates different predictive models to determine the most accurate for ROI optimization.

Supports decision-making for sports betting strategies using data-driven insights.

3. Album Analytics Project (R)

Analytical project examining musical attributes such as BPM, tone, and pitch.

Investigates which album characteristics correlate with higher streaming frequency.

Uses R for statistical analysis and visualization to uncover patterns in music consumption.

Provides insights into factors that influence listener engagement and popularity.

4. Album Retrieval System (Python)

Interactive system that returns albums based on user-specified criteria like genre, release year, and rating.

Enables exploration of music datasets based on listener preferences.

Focuses on filtering and ranking albums dynamically according to user input.

Demonstrates a practical application of Python for data-driven recommendation tools.
